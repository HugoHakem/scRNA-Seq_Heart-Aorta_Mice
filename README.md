# scRNA-Seq_Heart-Aorta_Mice

# Project: Study the difference in term of gene expression in Aorta and Heart cells from mice. 

## Hugo Hakem, Meng BIOE 23-24

Data used in this project are extracted from Tabula Muris: 
https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org/

In particular, the datasets can be found following this link:
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Single-cell_RNA-seq_data_from_Smart-seq2_sequencing_of_FACS_sorted_cells_v2_/5829687?file=13088129
where Aorta, and Heart sub datasets from FACS.selection have been used and Metadata and Annotations as well.

This project has been conducted by Hugo Hakem as part of Berkeley BIOE249: Computational Functional Genomics taught by the professor Liana Lareau, Department of Bioengineering.
